# Linux-Dotfiles
## Project Overview

This repository is a personal archive of the visual configurations (rices) I've created for various Linux setups.

Although this project is primarily for my own reference, Iâ€™ve made it public in case it can inspire or help others who are into ricing or experimenting with different Linux aesthetics.
